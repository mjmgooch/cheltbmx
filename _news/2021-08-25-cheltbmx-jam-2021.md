## Jam 2021

After many years away, we're holding a jam! After the success at the Olympics, we think its important to highlight this incredible outdoor facility thats been at the centre of the CheltBMX scence since it was built. 

Having been visited over the years by beginners and pro riders from afar, Pitville is a park the BMX community love, so lets show it some.

Join us on the 18th September for the 2021 Jam, prepare yourself for the stiff-backed riders of past generations, competitions with prizes from [@BQR123](https://www.instagram.com/bqr123/?hl=en) and general shithousery!

BYEPP!
